# Whiteboard App

This project is a whiteboard application built with React and TypeScript. It allows users to draw and interact with a virtual whiteboard.

## Project Layout

The project structure is as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the main source code files
  - `App.tsx`: The main component that renders the whiteboard
  - `v1/WhiteboardCanvas.tsx`: The whiteboard component implementation
  - `index.css`: Global styles for the application
  - `vite-env.d.ts`: Type definitions for Vite
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file
- `vite.config.ts`: Vite configuration file
- `.prettierrc` and `.prettierignore`: Prettier configuration for code formatting

## Setup and Running

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install the dependencies:
3. Start the development server:

4. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Roadmap

### Completed

- [x] Basic whiteboard functionality with drawing capabilities
- [x] Integration with React and TypeScript
- [x] Project setup using Vite

### Upcoming

- [ ] Optimize rendering performance of the whiteboard component
- [ ] Improve composability and modularity of the whiteboard components
- [ ] Implement support for different shapes and drawing tools
- [ ] Enable multiple users to collaborate on the same whiteboard in real-time

## Performance Optimization

To improve the rendering performance of the whiteboard component, consider the following:

- [ ] Implement efficient rendering techniques, such as virtualizing the drawing canvas
- [ ] Minimize unnecessary re-renders by using memoization or shouldComponentUpdate
- [ ] Optimize event handling and minimize the number of event listeners
- [ ] Profile and analyze the performance using browser developer tools or profiling libraries

## Composability and Expansion

To enhance the composability and extensibility of the whiteboard components:

- [ ] Break down the whiteboard into smaller, reusable components
- [ ] Use composition patterns like Higher-Order Components (HOCs) or Render Props
- [ ] Define clear interfaces and prop types for the components
- [ ] Implement a plugin system or extensible architecture to allow adding new shapes or features easily
